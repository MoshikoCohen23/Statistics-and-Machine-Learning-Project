# Statistics-and-Machine-Learning-Project
 ** Include Comprehensive PDF README File ** 
 
As part of this project, we developed prediction models to assess the students' academic success using statistical tools. Predicting student performance can be helpful in identifying those who may require additional support based on their personal and demographic characteristics. This focused approach allows for tailored interventions, such as mentoring and guidance, thus improving their chances of academic achievement. Initially, we analyzed the dataset, exploring the distribution and interrelationships of variables. Using various techniques, including neural networks, support vector machines (SVM), random forest, and logistic regression, we identified the factors that most influence student outcomes. After a thorough evaluation of all models, Random Forest was found to be the most suitable predictor for determining whether a student will pass or fail the academic year.

The repository comprises three types of files:
1. Excel data files.
2. Python and R scripts code.
3. PDF summary report encompassing methodology, modeling, results, and conclusions.
